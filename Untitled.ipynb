Moreover she claimed that she is \"almost to the point\"\\nof defending the segregation. After her post about the recent pool party\\nincident drew local attention, the teacher deleted her profile.\\n\\n\"This makes me ANGRY! This officer should not have had to resign. I\\'m\\ngoing to just go ahead and say it....the blacks are the ones causing the\\nproblems and this `racial tension. I  guess that\\'s what happens when you\\nflunk out of school and have no education. I\\'m sure their parents are just as\\nguilty for not knowing what their kids were doing; or knew it and didn\\'t care,\"\\nshe wrote. She also added,\"I\\'m almost to the point of wanting them all\\nsegregated on one side of town so they can hurt each other and leave the\\ninnocent people alone. Maybe the 50s and 60s were really on to something.\\nNow, let the bashing of my true and honest opinion begin .... GO! #imnotracist\\n#imsickofthemcausingtrouble #itwasagatedcommunity\".\\n\\nAs we see Karen Fitzgibbons is a real racist, who approves the humiliation of\\nblack people!
